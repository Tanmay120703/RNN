## üîÅ Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load or simulate sequential data
   - Preprocess into sequence/label format
   - Convert to PyTorch tensors

2. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Divide the dataset for training and validation

3. **Model Definition**:
   - PyTorch `nn.RNN` or custom RNN implementation
   - Linear output layer for prediction

4. **Training Loop**:
   - Forward pass, compute loss (`CrossEntropyLoss` or `MSELoss`)
   - Backpropagation with `optimizer.step()`

5. **Validation Loop**:
   - Evaluate on unseen data
   - Track loss and accuracy

6. **Evaluation & Visualization**:
   - Print metrics
   - Plot loss/accuracy trends

7. **Inference**:
   - Predict output for new sequence input
